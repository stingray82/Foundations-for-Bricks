======================

Foundations for Bricks - A plugin to add your templates and your global and
theme settings and speed up the setup of your bricks sites its designed for use
with ACSS

 

This plugin is designed too speed up a bricks site launch from a non-blueprint
it does the following themes

 

-   Installs The Global Settings from the export files here:  
    https://automaticcss.com/docs/how-to-setup-acss-with-bricks-builder/

-   Installs the Theme Settings fro the export files here:  
    https://automaticcss.com/docs/how-to-setup-acss-with-bricks-builder/

-   Sets the code warning to 1 so you don’t see it

-   Import Templates form (json/templates) named templateName-template.json

 

**Please Note:**

This is a plugin designed to be forked and customized for your delivery the
default version of this installs the settings above and a login template, once a
community template exists for a style guide I will likely change the example
template to that

I have designed it to be installed either by a “configuration” or “Bundle” or
via the CLI i.e the same as my fork of WP TASK on Install, it will once activate
do its thing and then deactivate itself which means it is then safe to delete
both of these are installed on startup in my configurations and prepare my
install for work
